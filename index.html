        <p>A car (plural: cars) is an automated vehicle consisting of a 
            group of mechanical parts. All these parts work in a coordinated 
            manner, leading to the movement of this vehicle, and the vehicle is 
            considered one of the most widespread 
            means of transportation in our time.</p>

        <p>An internal combustion engine is a heat engine in which a 
             fuel burns with an oxidizer (usually air) in the combustion 
             chamber, which is part of the fuel flow circuit. The expansion 
             of high-pressure and high-temperature gases produced by combustion
             in an internal combustion engine exerts a direct force on some engine 
             components. This force is applied to the pistons, turbine blades, and 
             impulse nozzle. This force moves the part it affects a certain distance as
              a result of the conversion of chemical energy into mechanical energy. This 
              type of engine has become an alternative to external combustion engines because
               the weight or size of the 
             engine has become important</p>

            <h3>Turbo</h3>
            <small>by: saif kh</small>
            <div class="date">1885</div>
         </header>

        <p>A turbocharger is a gas compressor used to compress air
             for an internal combustion engine to produce a higher
             horsepower given the size of the engine. The difference
             between the turbocharger and the supercharger is that the 
             supercharger rotates mechanically, usually by means of a belt 
             or gear from the crankshaft (crankshaft), while the turbocharger 
             rotates with exhaust gases. The turbocharger increases the entry 
             f air and fuel into the combustion chamber, and turbocharged engines 
             are usually more efficient than supercharged engines, but they are less 
             responsive. Turbochargers are commonly found in truck, car,
             train and construction equipment engines.

            <h3>The electric motor</h3>
            <small>by: saif kh</small>
            <div class="date">1821</div>

             <p>
             The electric motor was invented by the English scientist Michael Faraday in 1821.
             It is one of the devices that are widely used in our modern era, as it drives machines 
             in factories and drives electric trains, as well as operates sewing machines,
             runs electric washing machines, runs pumps in refrigerators, and others.
             There are many types of it, large and small, to suit every use.
